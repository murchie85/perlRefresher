## Introduction to Perl
Perl, short for "Practical Extraction and Reporting Language," is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. It is widely used for system administration, web development, network programming, and more. Perl is known for its powerful text processing capabilities and its philosophy of "There's more than one way to do it."

## Getting Started
- Install Perl: Most Unix-based systems, including macOS, come with Perl pre-installed. For Windows, you can download and install Strawberry Perl or ActivePerl.
- Writing Scripts: Perl scripts are files ending with `.pl`. You can use any text editor to write your scripts.
- Running Scripts: Execute a Perl script using the command `perl script_name.pl` in your terminal.

## Installing on Windows

[Instructions](WINDOWS.md)

## Important Perl Concepts

### Use strict and warnings
Always start your scripts with:
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
```
This helps catch common bugs and enforces good coding practices.

### Variables
Declare variables with `my` to create a new, lexically scoped variable:
```perl
my $variable = "value";
```

### Data Structures
Perl supports several data structures like scalars (`$`), arrays (`@`), and hashes (`%`).

## Regular Expressions (Regex)

### Basic Syntax
- Delimiters: `/pattern/`
- Metacharacters: Characters like `^`, `$`, `.`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `|`, `()`, `[]`, `{}` have special meanings.

### Common Patterns
- Match any digit: `\d`
- Match any non-digit: `\D`
- Match any word character (letter, digit, underscore): `\w`
- Match any non-word character: `\W`
- Match any whitespace: `\s`
- Match any non-whitespace: `\S`

### Quantifiers
- `*`: 0 or more
- `+`: 1 or more
- `?`: 0 or 1
- `{n}`: Exactly n times
- `{n,}`: n or more times
- `{n,m}`: Between n and m times

### Anchors
- `^`: Start of a string
- `$`: End of a string

### Example
To match a string that contains only digits:
```perl
if ($string =~ /^\d+$/) {
    print "String contains only digits.\n";
}
```

```perl
if ($numberOne !~ /^\d+$/) {
    print "Please enter a valid number.\n";
}
```


Certainly! Here's how you could format the explanation of Perl regular expressions, including examples and progressing up to email validation, in a README format:

# Perl Regular Expressions (Regex) Guide

This guide provides an overview of using regular expressions in Perl, starting from basic concepts and examples, and progressing towards more advanced usage including email validation.



## 1. Basic Regex

### Matching a Word
- **Regex**: `/hello/`
- **Example**: Matches the word "hello" in any string.

### Case Insensitive Matching
- **Regex**: `/hello/i`
- **Example**: Matches "hello", "Hello", "HeLLo", etc.

### Matching Any Character
- **Regex**: `/h.llo/`
- **Example**: Matches "hello", "hallo", "h3llo", etc.

### Matching One Character from a Set
- **Regex**: `/h[aeiou]llo/`
- **Example**: Matches "hallo", "hello", "hillo", etc.

## 2. Intermediate Regex

### Quantifiers
- **Regex**: `/he*llo/`
- **Example**: Matches "hllo", "hello", "heello", "heeello", etc.

### Anchors
- **Regex**: `/^hello/`
- **Example**: Matches strings that start with "hello".

### Escape Characters
- **Regex**: `/3\.14/`
- **Example**: Matches "3.14".

## 3. Advanced Regex

### Grouping and Capturing
- **Regex**: `/(hello) (world)/`
- **Example**: Matches "hello world" and captures "hello" and "world".

### Alternation
- **Regex**: `/cat|dog/`
- **Example**: Matches either "cat" or "dog".

### Non-Capturing Groups
- **Regex**: `/(?:hello) world/`
- **Example**: Matches "hello world" but does not capture "hello".

## 4. Email Validation

Email validation using regex can be complex. Below is a simplified example:

- **Regex**: `/^\S+@\S+\.\S+$/`
- **Explanation**:
  - `^\S+` - Matches the start of the string followed by one or more non-whitespace characters (local part of the email).
  - `@` - A literal "@" character.
  - `\S+\.` - Non-whitespace characters followed by a literal dot (domain part of the email).
  - `\S+$` - Non-whitespace characters until the end of the string (top-level domain).

*Note: This is a simplified version of an email validation regex and might not cover all valid email formats.*

## Best Practices and Tips

### Error Handling
Always check the return values of functions and handle exceptions appropriately.

### Code Readability
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Comment your code where necessary.

### Use CPAN Modules
Explore CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) for reusable modules that can simplify your tasks.

### Testing
Write tests for your code to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.

### Stay Updated
Perl evolves, so stay updated with the latest versions and features.
